## React Job Boards

This is dependant on [Node Job Boards](https://github.com/jnav24/node-job-boards)

I built this project only to get more familiar with the following:

- GraphQL
- Docker
- MongoDB

To run this project, run

```
yarn && yarn start
```

Runs the app in the development mode.<br />
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.
